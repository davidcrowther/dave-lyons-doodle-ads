          <h4>Fact #1: Customers don't care about you.</h4>
          <img src="img/img1.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>They don't care about how hard you've worked on your offering.</p>
          <p>They don't care how slick your product is.</p>
          <p>And they don't care how long it took you to get that slick online shopping cart set up.</p>
          <p>It's not that they're heartless people—they just don't have the time.  And this is where almost every marketing campaign gets it wrong.</p>
          <p>What do they care about?  Read on to find out...</p>

          <h4>Fact #2: Video is king.</h4>
          <img src="img/img2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>With Internet speeds way up, marketing videos have largely supplanted the written word in communicating with prospects.  Even mobile-friendly sites are moving toward video instead of text.</p>
          <p>If you're not up to speed on this, you can be sure that your competitors are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item item3">
          <h4>Fact #3: Prospects trust their gut, not their brain.</h4>
          <img src="img/img3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive" />
          <p>The one thing that customers do care about?  Solving their own problems.  If you can make an emotionally-compelling marketing video that shows how you'll solve their problems, they'll fall all over themselves trying to buy from you.</p>

        <h3>Stories From Our Clients</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <cite>Skeptical? Of course I was skeptical!  Cartoons are the sort of thing you watch on Saturday morning over sugary cereal with your kids... or so I used to think.  We gave Doodle Ads a try, not thinking it would do much, and holy cow were we surprised!  Our conversion rate is way higher than it was before, and we're practically flooded with business!  All because of a doodle ad; I can barely believe it, but hey - the numbers don't lie.</cite>
            <p class="name"><strong>Frank</strong>, Small Business Owner, 52</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <cite>We'd tried everything. Crazy SEO strategies, paid traffic (mostly bots, it turns out), crazy pop-ups, etc., you get the idea.  I was just about ready to give up on the business entirely—we knew our offer was solid, but we just couldn't get any traction.  Finally we approached Doodle Ads as a sort of last-ditch effort... at first, the change was modest, but as soon as the video went up we started seeing growth.  Now we're doing great!  I've hired more help, and we've got some real momentum!  That one video made all the difference.</cite>
            <p class="name"><strong>Al</strong>, Entrepreneur, 27</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-4">
            <cite>I knew that video was taking over the marketplace, but we're a small shop and none of us really know what we're doing in that format. The guys over at Doodle Ads were super friendly and easy to work with; they understood our offering very quickly, and broke it down into such easy, compelling terms that we've actually stolen part of the video script for our standard elevator speech!</cite>
